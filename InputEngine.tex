Here, we describe the libraries that help us to collect inputs
from input devices
such as the mouse, keyboard, joystick or other game controllers.

\section{DirectInput}
\label{sec:DirectInput}

It provides a system for action mapping, which allows the user to assign
specific actions within a game to the buttons and axes of the input devices. 

Microsoft recommends that new applications make use of the Windows message loop
for keyboard and mouse input instead of DirectInput, and use XInput for Xbox 360
console (Sect.\ref{sec:XInput}).


DirectInput was added from DirectX 1.0 in 1995 with true support for joystick,
i.e.
mouse and keyboard modules simply provided wrappers to the standard Win32 API.

DirectInput in DirectX 3.0 added support for keyboards and mice; it also
improved joystick support.


DirectInput in DirectX 5.0 (1997) included greatly improved joystick support,
including adding force feedback, increasing the number of buttons (mouse button
from 4 to 8), changing the underlying device-driver model and incorporating a
COM-based API.




\section{XInput}
\label{sec:XInput}

The new input library called XInput is specifically for the Xbox 360 controller.
