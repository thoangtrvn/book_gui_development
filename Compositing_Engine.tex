\chapter{Compositing Engines}
\label{sec:compositing_engine}  


A compositing engine combines visual elements from separate source into single
images.
All compositing involves the replacement of selected parts of an image with
other material, usually, but not always, from another image.

\section{ Desktop Window Manager}

DWM is the new name for Desktop Compositing Engine or DCE.

The Desktop Window Manager is a compositing window manager.
This means that each program has a buffer that it writes data to; DWM then
composites each program's buffer into a final image.
  
  
DWM uses DirectX 9 to perform the function of compositing and rendering in the
GPU, freeing the CPU of the task of managing the rendering from the off-screen
buffers to the display.
However, applications painting to the off-screen buffers - depending on the
technologies used for that, might still be CPU-bound.
