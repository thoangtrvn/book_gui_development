GTK\# is a Graphical User Interface Toolkit for mono and .Net.
GTK\# is a .NET binding for the GTK+ toolkit. The GTK+ toolkit
(Chap.\ref{chap:GTK+}) is written in C for speed and compatibility, while the
GTK\# binding provides an easy to use, object oriented API for managed use. 

In general, GTK\# applications are written using MonoDevelop, which provides a
visual designer for creating GTK\# GUIs.

Platforms: Unix, Windows, OSX.
