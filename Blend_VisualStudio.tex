{\bf Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio} (formerly Microsoft Expression Blend
\footnote{It was one of the applications in the Microsoft Expression Studio
suite before that suite was discontinued.
\url{https://www.microsoft.com/expression/eng/}}) helps you design and build
engaging and sophisticated user interfaces by providing you with an accurate
design surface and tools that let you visually create and edit Microsoft Windows
applications.

It is an interactive, WYSIWYG front-end for designing XAML-based interfaces for
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight applications.

It can be used to build
\begin{itemize}

\section{SketchFlow (prototype)}
\label{sec:SketchFlow}

With SketchFlow, a designer can quickly and easily create an interactive map
that represents the flow of an application.
It contains a number of {\it screens} - a virtual whiteboard
 on which you can scribble, draw, write, or insert any of the existing user
interface (UI) modeling features of Blend to build a UI. You can also use
screens to create reusable elements such as logos, backgrounds, or UI templates,
and then include those screens as elements in other screens.
